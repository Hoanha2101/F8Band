# My First Website

This is my first attempt at building a website using HTML and CSS. It's a simple project, but it marks the beginning of my journey into web development.

## About

This website serves as my playground to experiment with different HTML and CSS techniques. It includes basic elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, and images, styled with CSS for a visually appealing presentation.

## Technologies Used

## Getting Started

To view the website, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Contributing
